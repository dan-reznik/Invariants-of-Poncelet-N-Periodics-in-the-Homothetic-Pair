A trace is a sum 
of the traced quantity
over the vertices of a polygon.

We describe quantities,
invariant with respect to Euclidean transformations,
whose traces over the family
of affine images of regular polygons
depend only on the area and the eccentricity of the outer ellipse,
but not on the remaining rotational parameter.
These include the distance to a focus,
the kinetic energy (certain power of curvature),
the squared sidelength, the cotangent of internal and external angles,
and the area of a certain ``evolute'' polygon.
We express these as Laurent polynomials in a natural parameter;
the trace is constant as long as certain Fourier coefficients vanish,
e.g. if gonality exceeds the degree.
Finally, we compare these quantities with their analogues for
the periodic trajectories of the elliptic billiard. % (confocal pair).
