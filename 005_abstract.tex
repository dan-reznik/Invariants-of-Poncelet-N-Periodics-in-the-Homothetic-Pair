\begin{abstract}
We describe and prove two new invariants manifested by the ``homothetic'' family, i.e., a family of Poncelet N-gons interscribed between two concentric, axis-aligned, homothetic ellipses. In contradistinction with the confocal family (elliptic billiard) which conserves perimeter, Joachimsthal's constant, and the sum of internal angle cosines, the homothetic family conserves area, sum of squared sidelengths, and the sum of internal angle cotangents.
