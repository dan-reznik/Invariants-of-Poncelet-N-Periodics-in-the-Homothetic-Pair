	abstract = {This perspective highlights the mean ergodic theorem established by John von Neumann and the pointwise ergodic theorem established by George Birkhoff, proofs of which were published nearly simultaneously in PNAS in 1931 and 1932. These theorems were of great significance both in mathematics and in statistical mechanics. In statistical mechanics they provided a key insight into a 60-y-old fundamental problem of the subject{\textemdash}namely, the rationale for the hypothesis that time averages can be set equal to phase averages. The evolution of this problem is traced from the origins of statistical mechanics and Boltzman{\textquoteright}s ergodic hypothesis to the Ehrenfests{\textquoteright} quasi-ergodic hypothesis, and then to the ergodic theorems. We discuss communications between von Neumann and Birkhoff in the Fall of 1931 leading up to the publication of these papers and related issues of priority. These ergodic theorems initiated a new field of mathematical-research called ergodic theory that has thrived ever since, and we discuss some of recent developments in ergodic theory that are relevant for statistical mechanics.},

Abstract      = {We prove some recent experimental observations of D. Reznik concerning
periodic billiard orbits in ellipses. For example, the sum of cosines of the
angles of a periodic billiard polygon remains constant in the one-parameter
family of such polygons (that exist due to the Poncelet porism). In our proofs,
we use geometric and complex analytic methods.},
